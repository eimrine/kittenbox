kittenbox
=========

this is my try to pass exam in some place.

My tasks:
Make rubber maket: header and 2 columns. 
In left column there have to be some text. 
In right column there have to be inline-box div with 4 kittens. 
First line of JS code must be array with some numbers. 
In header must be 2 links: 
shuffle kittens _&&_ 
console.log ONLY negative elements of that array. 

my final version: http://jsfiddle.net/r7m870sk/
